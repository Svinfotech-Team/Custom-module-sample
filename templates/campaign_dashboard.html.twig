            <p><strong>Note on Pipeline Requirement:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>To create a deal in ActiveCampaign, at least one pipeline must exist.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>ActiveCampaign Stages:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Accessing the ActiveCampaign Stages Tab:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigate to the tab labeled "ActiveCampaign Stages."</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Creating a New Stage:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The page will display a form to create a new stage for a pipeline in ActiveCampaign.</li>
              <li>Fields in the form usually include:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Pipeline:</strong> A select field with options of existing pipelines to choose from.</li>
                  <li><strong>Title:</strong> A text field to name the new stage.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Viewing Existing Stages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The page will also contain a table showing all existing stages within their respective pipelines.</li>
              <li>One of the columns in this table will likely indicate the pipeline to which each stage belongs.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>By utilizing these tabs and the provided forms and tables within your Drupal interface, you can create and manage pipelines and stages in ActiveCampaign. This allows you to structure your deals effectively and set up the necessary stages for your sales or workflow processes without directly accessing the ActiveCampaign dashboard.</p></p>

      <button class="accordion">How to Create deal using deal form</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
        <p>When using the "Create Deal" form, you're presented with a field called "Select Options" that offers two distinct options for handling deal creation for listed contacts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Create this deal for all listed contacts individually:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Choosing this option will result in the deal being duplicated for each selected contact individually.</li>
              <li>For example, if you select three contacts and create a deal with this option, three separate instances of the same deal will be created, with each deal associated with one of the selected contacts individually.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Create one deal for all contacts listed:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Opting for this choice will create a single deal that encompasses all the selected contacts.</li>
              <li>In this scenario, the deal will be associated with multiple contacts, aggregating them under one single deal in ActiveCampaign.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Regarding the rest of the fields in the "Create Deal" form, they likely consist of standard details required for setting up a deal, such as deal name, value, expected close date, deal stage, etc. Simply fill in these fields with the appropriate information as needed.</p>
        <p>This flexibility allows you to either create individual deals for each contact or group multiple contacts under a single deal, depending on how you want to manage your deals and contacts within ActiveCampaign through your Drupal interface.</p>
